   * comment: Don't show comments of subpages on parent pages.
     (Fixes bug introduced in version 3.20100505.)
   * darcs: Fix multiple issues preventing rcs\_diff from working.
   * aggregate: Read cookies from ~/.ikiwiki/cookies by default.
     Also, the cookiejar configuration setting can be used by
     other plugins to provide a custom `cookie\_jar` object for LWP::UserAgent.
     (Thanks, schmonz)
   * Avoid escaping / characters in filenames when building the cgiurl,
     as this confuses eg, cvsweb."""]]
